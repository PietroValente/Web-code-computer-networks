## Overview
During the Computer Networks course, I studied various aspects of network communication, including HTTP protocols. Throughout the course, I developed programs that can act as clients, proxies, or servers, and gained hands-on experience in building network applications.

As part of the course, I participated in laboratory sessions where I worked on projects that involved modifying the starting code to add new functionalities. The projects challenged me to apply the knowledge I had learned in class to real-world scenarios and to improve my skills in network programming and application development.

The projects showcased here are examples of the types of applications that I built during the laboratory sessions of the Computer Networks course. Each project demonstrates my ability to create functional and efficient network programs and to solve complex problems related to network communication.
