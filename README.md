## Overview
The Computer Networks course that I completed provided me with in-depth knowledge, up to the implementation level, of various network protocols. These protocols include:

* HyperText-Transport-Protocol 1.0 and 1.1
* Transmission Control Protocol
* User Datagram Protocol
* Internet Protocol
* Internet Control Messaging Protocol
* Address Resolution Protocol
* Ethernet Protocol
* During the course, I learned how to comprehend protocol specifications, and how to implement the protocols through programming in the C language. I also gained the ability to correct and test protocol implementations.

The course covered the study of network protocols following the OSI model, in a top-down approach, from the application layer (Layer 7) to the data link layer (Layer 2). Topics covered in the course include the comparison between the client-server and peer-to-peer models, as well as the Publish/Subscribe/Notify model.

I also learned about various network protocols, such as HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, ARP, and Ethernet. The course also covered the concept of middleboxes, including Firewalling, NAT/NAPT, Proxy, and Tunneling. Through the course, I gained the knowledge and skills necessary to develop and implement network applications, and to troubleshoot issues related to network communication.
